          The planning phase of a <em>Wolbachia</em> is critical because

          population demographics, health systems costing, environmental
          covariates, and vector bionomics that are all likely to affect the

          The preparation phase of a<em>Wolbachia</em> includes the regulatory

          from country to country is an opaque process, and one that would
          likely benefit from cooperation and sharing of experiences across
          implementers and countries. One potential driver of cost in this phase
          is the completion of an Environmental Impact Assessment, the cost of
          which may vary depending on the regulatory standards of the country of

          Stakeholder and community engagement costs vary heavily by geography,
          as well as on the strategies chosen for their completion. For
          instance, social mobilization and community sensitization can comprise
          large proportions of a program budget, including up to 23% of total
          deployment costs in a scaled up Aedes aegypti release by the World
          Mosquito Program in Northern Australia (

          dependent on the methods used for implementation. For instance, mass
          media outreach will entail a different range of costs than
          on-the-ground visits to many affected towns or villages spread across
          a wide geographic area.

        <Typography sx={{ pt: 1 }}>
          A key question affecting the costs of these efforts will be the
          measurement of success. If surveys are undertaken to show the impact
          of community engagement on public opinion, and if there are target
          levels of community approval that must be achieved to make the
          intervention acceptable to program staff or local government
          officials, these are likely to increase program costs for community
          engagement in comparison to purely educational efforts. Additionally,
          if an intervention intends to leverage community in-program
          distribution or implementation, through egg distribution or insect
          collection teams (i.e., the integrated model), this may reduce cost in
          the release and monitoring phases but will also require larger
          up-front investments in community engagement and training. It is
          possible that some programs will be able to reduce costs by
          integrating their community engagement and training efforts with
          existing programs for dengue control or public health campaigns such
          as mass drug administration, the likelihood of which will depend on
          the public health infrastructure and existing health interventions in
          the geographic area in question.

          The production phase of a mosquito intervention is typically dominated
          by fixed costs for mosquito rearing and mass production that are
          reliant on an established manufacturing facility. Building or leasing
          an appropriate facility will represent the largest proportion of costs

          rearing facility and several smaller adult emergence centers, or sends
          centrally produced eggs internationally will impact costs in this
          phase by determining the number of facilities to be built and workers
          to be trained. These considerations are discussed at length in the
          distribution section. The creation of a mosquito breeding line will
          generally represent a fixed cost category across intervention sites.

          The proportion of costs dedicated to the distribution and release of
          lab-augmented mosquitoes will be driven by several factors.
          Interventions that involve the release of adult mosquitoes must
          consider survival factors that are independent of those important for
          egg distribution. Major differences in mosquito genera requirements
          will drive the cost of distribution and release (for example, the
          ability to sex-sort pupae which is feasible at scale for Aedes). Once
          they have been sex-sorted, adult mosquitoes can be chilled and
          compacted for smooth transport to their release location (
          <NLink

          ). This lowers the metabolism of the adult mosquitoes to a point where
          large numbers can be compacted into small tubes for transport with a
          reduced risk of death or injury and eventual competitiveness. For
          Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, a study has shown that overnight air
          transport after chilling to a temperature between 7 and 14¬∞C resulted
          in the highest survival rate when mosquitoes were compacted to 240
          individuals/cm3, even though this resulted in partial damage to

          ). Shipping eggs is generally cheaper and typically bears less of a
          regulatory burden than the shipment of live adults. For those
          interventions relying upon the shipment of eggs from international or
          regional production hubs, Aedes eggs can be desiccated and packaged

          evaluating programmatic success and monitoring any unintended effects

          ). Costs associated with the establishment of an appropriate capture
          grid may vary and the actual capture may vary. Once the mosquitoes are
          captured and sorted, any additional analysis that needs to occur for
          measuring uptake of the intervention will add to program costs. This
          would involve determining what proportion of captured mosquitoes have
          been colonized by the
          <em>Wolbachia</em>.

          Epidemiological monitoring activities include the detection of lowered
          incidence of infection or clinical disease in human populations
          associated with the mosquito release area. Reductions in infections
          are often measured alongside decreased morbidity and mortality
          relating to the diseases of interest. If a field trial aims to detect
          decreasing infection incidence, this will be achievable with a smaller
          and less expensive cohort compared to field trails that aim to detect
          decreasing incidence of disease, as clinical disease development is
          not guaranteed in all those infected (
          <NLink
            href="https://www.who.int/tdr/publications/year/2014/Guidance_framework_mosquitoes.pdf"
            text="WHO, 2014"
          />
          ). The costs of detecting these endpoints are often bound to the time
          it takes to detect a meaningful difference from base-rates of disease,
          which is most easily detected in high-transmission settings. If there
          are very few cases in a release area, then a field trial will take
          longer to show a detectable decrease in cases over time. This is a key
          consideration when projecting costs for a <em>Wolbachia</em>, which
          may be affected by seasonality and year-to-year variations which
          affect the length of time needed to conduct a strong epidemiologic
          evaluation of an intervention. Finally, disease monitoring will be
          highly dependent on the existing local clinical infrastructure that
          can be accessed for disease detection, which would have important cost
          implications.
